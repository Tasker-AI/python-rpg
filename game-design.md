# Basic RPG Game Design

## Game Concept
A simple top-down RPG where the player controls a hero who must explore a small world, collect items, battle enemies, and complete a quest.

## Core Game Elements

### Player Character
- Stats: health, attack, defense, woodcutting, firemaking, fishing, cooking, mining, smithing, agility
- Inventory system (using dictionaries and lists)
- Experience and leveling system

### Game World
- Simple grid-based map (using 2D lists/arrays)
- Multiple map areas, each with different terrain types (grass, water, forest, mountains)
- NPCs and shops in towns
- Enemies in wilderness areas
- Hidden treasure and items

### Game Mechanics
1. **Movement**: Click to move
2. **Combat**: Game tick based combat system
   - Player attacks each x ticks, depending on the weapon speed
   - Enemy attacks each x ticks, depending on the enemy
   - Damage calculation based on attack, defense, armor, and random factors
   - Enemy has a certain range, and will stop attacking if player is outside of this range
3. **Inventory Management**:
   - Collect and use items (weapons, armor, potions, resources)
   - Equip items to improve stats
   - Drop or sell unwanted items
   - Inventory has 28 slots
   - Bank has 100 slots. Items can be deposited or withdrawn to inventory
4. **Save/Load System**:
   - Save game progress to a file automatically every game tick
   - Load game progress automatically from a file
   - Ability to choose your character before logging in.
5. **Quest System**:
   - Simple quest with objectives
   - Track progress using variables and dictionaries

### Core Systems

#### Player System
- Store player data in a dictionary
- Functions for movement, combat, inventory management
- Experience and level-up calculations

#### Map System
- 2D list to represent the game world
- Each cell contains information about terrain and objects
- Collision detection for impassable terrain

#### Combat System
- Turn-based combat using while loops and conditionals
- Random number generation for damage calculation
- Enemy AI with simple decision-making

#### Inventory System
- List of dictionaries to store items
- Functions to add, remove, use, and equip items
- Filtering and sorting functions for item management

#### Dialog and Shop System
- Display text using Pygame text rendering
- Multiple-choice responses using keyboard input
- Shop inventory and buying/selling mechanics

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Framework
- Set up Pygame
- Implement basic player movement
- Create simple map rendering

### Phase 2: Core Gameplay
- Add collision detection
- Implement basic combat
- Create inventory system

### Phase 3: Content and Polish
- Add more enemies, items, and map areas
- Implement save/load system
- Add music and sound effects
- Polish UI and visuals

## Next Steps
1. Create the project structure and files
2. Set up Pygame and the main game loop
3. Implement player movement and map rendering
4. Build the inventory and combat systems
5. Add content and test gameplay
