# Basic RPG Game Design

## Game Concept
A simple top-down RPG where the player controls a hero who must explore a small world, collect items, battle enemies, and complete a quest.

## Core Game Elements

### Player Character
- Stats: health, attack, defense, woodcutting, firemaking, fishing, cooking, mining, smithing, agility
- Inventory system (using dictionaries and lists)
- Experience and leveling system

### Game World
- The game world is represented as a tile-based map (32x32 pixel tiles)
- The map is 250x200 tiles (8000x6400 pixels), providing a large area for exploration
- Different terrain types (grass, water, trees, rocks, etc.) with varying walkability
- Multiple distinct areas (towns, dungeons, forests, etc.)
- NPCs with dialogue and quests
- Collision detection for impassable terrain and objects
- Player character always centered on screen with the map scrolling around them
- All resource images (trees, rocks, etc.) must have transparent backgrounds using colorkey=-1 (top-left pixel color)
- Resources should have a high Z-index to ensure they appear above the player character

### Game Mechanics
1. **Movement**: Tile-based movement system
   - Click on a tile to show a visual indicator and queue movement
   - Movement only occurs on game ticks (every 0.6 seconds)
   - Multiple clicks queue up with only the most recent being processed
   - A* pathfinding to find optimal path
   - Each tile movement takes one game tick (0.6 seconds)
   - Diagonal movement allowed when no obstacles block the way
   - Visual feedback shows where clicks occur
   - Player character remains centered on screen at all times
   - Map scrolls to follow player movement
2. **User Interface**: All interactions are mouse-based
   - Mouse-only controls (no keyboard input)
   - Click to move, click buttons for actions
   - Visual indicators show where clicks occur
   - Actions queue up and execute on game ticks
   - Minimalist UI with clear feedback
   - Health, stats, and inventory displays
3. **Input System**
   - Mouse-only controls
   - Click to show indicator and queue movement
   - Visual feedback for all clicks
   - Tick-based action processing (0.6 seconds per tick)
   - Click on objects to interact
   - Click on UI buttons for menus and actions
   - Click on enemies to attack them
3. **Combat**: Game tick based combat system
   - Each game tick is exactly 0.6 seconds
   - Player attacks each x ticks, depending on the weapon speed
   - Enemy attacks each x ticks, depending on the enemy
   - Damage calculation based on attack, defense, armor, and random factors
   - Enemy has a certain range, and will stop attacking if player is outside of this range
3. **Inventory Management**:
   - Collect and use items (weapons, armor, potions, resources)
   - Equip items to improve stats
   - Drop or sell unwanted items
   - Inventory has 28 slots
   - Bank has 100 slots. Items can be deposited or withdrawn to inventory
4. **Save/Load System**:
   - Save game progress to a file automatically every game tick
   - Load game progress automatically from a file
   - Ability to choose your character before logging in.
5. **Quest System**:
   - Simple quest with objectives
   - Track progress using variables and dictionaries

### Core Systems

#### Player System
- Store player data in a dictionary
- Functions for movement, combat, inventory management
- Experience and level-up calculations

#### Map System
- Tile-based map with 32x32 pixel tiles
- Different terrain types with varying properties (walkable, blocking)
- A* pathfinding algorithm for player movement
- Map scrolling with player always centered on screen
- Optimized rendering that only draws visible tiles (with buffer for smooth scrolling)
- Map transitions between different areas

#### Combat System
- Turn-based combat using while loops and conditionals
- Random number generation for damage calculation
- Enemy AI with simple decision-making

#### Inventory System
- List of dictionaries to store items
- Functions to add, remove, use, and equip items
- Filtering and sorting functions for item management

#### Dialog and Shop System
- Display text using Pygame text rendering
- Multiple-choice responses using keyboard input
- Shop inventory and buying/selling mechanics

## Technical Architecture

### Engine Components
- Game State Management: Controls different game states (menu, play, etc.)
- Asset Management: Loads and caches images, sounds, and other assets
- Input Handling: Processes mouse input for movement and UI interaction
- Logging System: Comprehensive logging for debugging and diagnostics

### Development Tools
- Python 3.x with Pygame library
- Git for version control
- Unit testing framework for game logic
- Detailed logging system with file and console output

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Framework
- Set up Pygame
- Implement basic player movement
- Create simple map rendering

### Phase 2: Core Gameplay
- Add collision detection
- Implement basic combat
- Create inventory system

### Phase 3: Content and Polish
- Add more enemies, items, and map areas
- Implement save/load system
- Add music and sound effects
- Polish UI and visuals

## Next Steps
1. Create the project structure and files
2. Set up Pygame and the main game loop
3. Implement player movement and map rendering
4. Build the inventory and combat systems
5. Add content and test gameplay
